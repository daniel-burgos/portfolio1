This virtual tour is one fo the more creative projects I have helped produced. The scope for the project was to help students without any culinary expereince familiarize themselves with the Sysco kitchen prior to the first day of classes. The professor expressed the need for more additional class time, but this need was due to how much time was spent looking for items or equipment. If students had a way to familiarize themselves with the kitchen, and know how to use certain equipment before the first day of classes, they would be better prepared. Hence, the 360 Virtual Tour of the Sysco kitchen. Please click the link below to view the tour.
