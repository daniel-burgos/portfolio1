    My name is Daniel Casanova. I have a Master's in Curriculum and Instructional Design: Learning Design and Technology from the University of Houston. I am currently an Instructional Designer at the University of Houston College of Global Hospitality Leadership. 
    
    I have three years of teaching experience; the first two years I taught math, and the last year before my transition as an instructional designer, I taught AP Computer Science; 85% of my students scored a 3 or above on the AP exam earning their first college credit.

    My first year teaching, and the first year of my graduate studies was during the pandemic of 2020. The virtual shift in education forced everyone to shift their teaching strategies to an online medium. As it turns out, virtual education is not the best fit for most K-12 students.

    This need inspired me to implement a flipped classroom model. I wanted my students to have access to my lecture at all times, and thus, my journey as EdTech educator began. These first three years in my career were my first exposure to an LMS and video editing.

    These experiences armed me with the skills I would need to transition to instructional design at the University of Houston. During my first year I helped all of the professors in my college transition their content from Blackboard to Canvas. I helped create a template for our online Master's program. On my second year I helped plan our Doctorate in Global Hospitality and Leadership, and my third year, I produced, edited, and delivered all of our online lectures with an emphasis on accessibility online.

    Through these projecs word has spread among the faculty and now the faculty feel comfortable in coming to me with early iterations of projects or ideas for their courses that they are unsure if they're feasible.Since then, every year I have been promoted and now possess the title of Instructional Designer III, along with the "Rising Star" award (awarded to the most accomplished staff member at the Conrad N. Hilton College).

    My flexibility and eagerness to learn enables me to tackle new projects outside of my skill set since these projects are an avenue for me to add another skill to my skill set. 

    Looking forward to chatting with ya'll! 🤠
