    My name is Daniel Casanova, and I have a Master's in Curriculum and Instructional Design: Learning Design and Technology from the University of Houston. I am currently an Instructional Designer at the University of Houston College of Global Hospitality and Leadership. I have three years of teaching experience; the first two years I taught math, and the last year before my transition, I taught AP Computer Science.
    
    Throught my professional career I have integrated my personal love for technology into my career. This began during my first year teaching where I integrated the flipped classroom model to circumvent the issues the pandemic posed on education. From there I transitioned to teach AP Computer Science as I continued to pursue my love for technology and learning. During my time there I taught students HTML, CSS, Python and Javascript; I helped 8/10 students score a 3/5 or above on the AP Computer Science test.

    In my current role as an instructional designer, I create videos and templates for the college using Final Cut Pro and HTML/CSS. I consult with professors on best practices when using Canvas and deliver trainings on online accessibility, and new software for professors and students. I also create educational materials using Articulate 360/Storyline, and assist in updating educational content for the creation of the upcoming online master's/bachelor's program hosted by the University of Houston.
