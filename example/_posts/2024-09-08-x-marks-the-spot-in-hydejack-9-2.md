During the fall of 2024 the College of Global Hospitality Leadership at the University of Houston began the preparations to launch the Doctorate in Global Hospitality Leadership fully online. As the instructionial designer for the college, I was the sole person helping professors bring their content for the digital realm. My job was to direct, produce, and publish the instructional videos on Canvas as the chosen learning management system for the Univeristy of Houston. 

In this specific video, it was my goal to share with the upcomign doctoral students my most crucial tips to get started at using Canvas from the perspective of the professor. You will find the videos for this two part session in the links below.
